# Noted
[Livesite](http://noted-js.co/)

This project is a notecard app I refer to as Noted. It utilizes the [Supermemo2 algorithm](https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm) to inform users of notecards they need to review. I created a notecard app specifically because I would like to have a tool to facilitate my learning as a developer. I created to serve as my introduction to a variety of technologies including:

- PHP and the [Laravel Framework](https://laravel.com/)
- The ORM [Eloquent](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/eloquent)
- Deploying an application with [Laravel Forge](https://forge.laravel.com/) and hosting it with [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Vue3](https://vuejs.org/) (my prior exeriences were in Vue2)
- Using [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) for state management across components
